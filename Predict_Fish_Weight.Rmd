# Predicting Fish Weight



## Perch

```{r}
Fish <- read.csv("Fish.csv")
Perch <- filter(Fish, Species=="Perch")
Perch <- select (Perch,-Species)
```

### Best Two regressor model

```{r}
library(leaps)
regsubsets.out <-
    regsubsets(Weight ~ .,
               data = Perch,
               nbest = 1,       # 1 best model for each number of predictors
               nvmax = NULL,    # NULL for no limit on number of variables
               force.in = NULL, force.out = NULL,
               method = "exhaustive")

summary.out <- summary(regsubsets.out)
as.data.frame(summary.out$outmat)
library(car)
subsets(regsubsets.out,statistic="adjr2",legend="topright",main="Adjusted R^2")
```

The two best regressive models are Height and Weight because their adjusted R^2 is closer to 1 (0.9400).

```{r}
perchmodel <- lm (Weight~ Height + Width, data=Perch)
summary.lm(perchmodel)
```


```{r}
pmodel <- lm (Weight~ Height + Width + Length1+ Length2+ Length3, data=Perch)
summary.lm(pmodel)
```

We used models that gave us our residual standard error and adjusted r^2 in order to double check our first claim. Since the adjusted r^2 is closer to 1, it proves that these models are the best fit. Our standard error is at its lowest with Height and Weight. 

## Bream

```{r}
Fish <- read.csv("Fish.csv")
Bream <- filter(Fish, Species=="Bream")
Bream <- select (Bream,-Species)
```

### Best Two regressor model

```{r}
library(leaps)
regsubsets.out <-
    regsubsets(Weight ~ .,
               data = Bream,
               nbest = 1,       # 1 best model for each number of predictors
               nvmax = NULL,    # NULL for no limit on number of variables
               force.in = NULL, force.out = NULL,
               method = "exhaustive")

summary.out <- summary(regsubsets.out)
as.data.frame(summary.out$outmat)
library(car)
subsets(regsubsets.out,statistic="adjr2",legend="bottomright",main="Adjusted R^2")
```
The best two regressive models are Length 1, Height, and Width then Length 2 and Height because they are closest to 1 which means its more accurate than the rest. 

```{r}
breammodel <- lm (Weight~ Height + Width, data=Bream)
summary.lm(breammodel)
```

```{r}
model3 <- lm (Weight~ Height + Width + Length1+ Length2+ Length3, data=Bream)
summary.lm(model3)
```
This model shows us how accurate our two regressive models because they are closer to one with the adjusted r^2.
